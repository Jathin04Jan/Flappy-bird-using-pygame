# Flappy Bird Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic game "Flappy Bird" using Python and Pygame. In this game, the player controls a bird that flies through a series of pipes by clicking the mouse or pressing the space bar. The goal is to navigate the bird safely through the pipes without crashing.

## Installation and Setup

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python installed. If not, download and install it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
3. Install the required packages by running `pip install pygame`.
4. Run the game by executing `python flappy_bird.py`.

## How to Play

- Press the space bar to make the bird flap its wings and fly upward.
- The bird will fall downward automatically due to gravity.
- Navigate the bird safely through the gaps between the pipes.
- If the bird collides with a pipe or the ground, the game is over.
- Try to get the highest score by flying through as many gaps as possible.
